    "The purpose of this notebook is to use a prompt given to some LLM (\"LLM A\") to generate a dataset of different prompts to be fed to some other LLM (\"LLM B\" - potentially the same as \"LLM A\") for which you have access to the weights. This dataset of prompts will be used to create a \"representation vector\" of a property or concept for LLM B in order to \"steer\" LLM B to have more of that property or concept in its outputs. This Notebook does not cover the creation of representations or steering, only the the creation of a dataset of prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kinds of prompts you want to generate should be about the property or concept you want to steer the LLM towards, not necessary literally mentioning it - e.g. prompts about politeness do not necessarily need to have the word polite in them. Part of the point of dataset creation is to explore which kinds of generated prompts yield good representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Setup section loads Python libraries needed to run the code. You do not need to change anything here.\n",
    "- The Inputs section is where you define the prompt you will use to generate your dataset of prompts. Instructions on how to do this are given. This is the only section of the notebook where you will need to change anything.\n",
    "- The Review section then generates a small example dataset of prompts and shows them to you. If you like them, continue on to the end of the Notebook.\n",
    "- If you do not like them, please go back to the Inputs section to refine your prompt to generate your dataset of prompts.\n",
    "- The Dataset Generation section completes the dataset generation.\n",
    "- The View Dataset section loads your generated dataset for inspection.\n",
    "- Your dataset will be stored in /data/inputs/name_of_your_dataset/dataset if you want to use it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets will be generated in CSV format and should have the following form, where the first line is the column headings and subsequent lines are for example prompts. The columns ethical_area and ethical_valence are two different labels (classifications) of the prompt. The Notebook will help you generate these labels. This example is for \"politeness\" prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "prompt, ethical_area, ethical_valence\n",
    "\"Would you be so kind as to pass the water please.\", \"polite\", 1\n",
    "\"Give me the water now.\", \"impolite\", 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is too restrictive, you will be able to create other columns and the notebook will ask you about that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that where we have text, such as for the prompt or ethical_area, we want it enclosed in quote marks. Lone numbers do not need this.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is something unusual you want to do that the current notebook does not permist, please ask, or feel free to try adding code for it. "
