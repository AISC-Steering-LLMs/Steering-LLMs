Testing directions

    Activation for concept C under prompting conditions P.

We want to test for the concept of [insert cocnept] when we have prompted the model to think in [insert moral theory] terms.

    Activations that co-vary reliably between concepts

We want to test whether there is activation overlap between concepts C1 and C2 (e.g., truth, honesty) or other possible relationships between concepts.

    Activations that indicate consistency in a model's preferences

3.1. Search for behavioral patterns (e.g., under what conditions does the model reply in the terms of [insert moral theory])
3.2. Search for activation patterns in these behaviors
3.3. Indications that a model tends to avoid a style of reasoning (the reason for this is obvious for finedtuned versions)

    Suppose we have found the vector for honesty; now, go back to a case where the model is telling the truth but the activation doesn't light up. This way we will find whether the correspondences are reliable.
