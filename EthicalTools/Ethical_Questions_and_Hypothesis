# Can we quantify the degree to which a concept is present within a prompt?

(fx. Honesty, Evil, etc...) - Similar to "Ambiguity" measures

Test-hypothesis: If we can identify a good classifier between a concept and its antithesis, the distance to said classier boundary will correlate with the presence of the concept in each prompt


# Can we identify if a concept is inherent in another concept?

(fx. Honesty ∈ Integrity ∈ Good) - Generating ethical landscapes by structuring relationships between individual ethical components

Test-hypothesis: If Honesty ∈ Integrity, then we would assume that we would observe overlap of activations from integrity and activations from honesty


# Is there a hierarchical structure of ethical concepts, and we manipulate this structure

(fx. saving life > telling the truth)

Test-hypothesis: If one principle is inherently superseding the other, then we the default answers in evaluations should show that. 
If we can re-arrange this ethical hierarchical structure, we should be able to increase importance of central concepts through activation steering
