# QUESTION: Can we quantify the degree to which a concept is present within a prompt?

(fx. Honesty, Evil, etc...) - Similar to "Ambiguity" measures

Test-hypothesis: If we can identify a good classifier between a concept and its antithesis, the distance to said classier boundary will correlate with the presence of the concept in each prompt


# QUESTION: Can we identify if a concept is inherent in another concept?

(fx. Honesty ∈ Integrity ∈ Good) - Generating ethical landscapes by structuring relationships between individual ethical components

Test-hypothesis: If Honesty ∈ Integrity, then we would assume that we would observe overlap of activations from integrity and activations from honesty


# QUESTION: Is there a hierarchical structure of ethical concepts, and we manipulate this structure

(fx. saving life > telling the truth)

Test-hypothesis: If one principle is inherently superseding the other, then we the default answers in evaluations should show that. 
If we can re-arrange this ethical hierarchical structure, we should be able to increase importance of central concepts through activation steering


# QUESTION: Can we assess if and when the "end" justify the means?

(fx. SBF scamming money from clients to save the world through EA-donations)

TEST-HYPOTHESIS: We might need a specific template-structure to run this. Something that includes a CONSEQUENCE of the action:

TEMPLATE-idea: You are doing {A}, which is obviously bad, but {A} leads to {B}, which is for the greate good. You feel good about this, because..


# QUESTION: How important is "intentionality" when evaluating the valence/magnitude of ethical content?

(fx. if we try to donate money for school-children in Rwanda, but it gets intercepted by a militia, who spends it on weapons to attack a village)

TEST-HYPOTHESIS: If we compare the scenario, where we intend {A}, but our action unintendedly leads to {B}, with scenarios where we intend {A} and get {A}, 
as well as scenarios, where we intend {B} and obtain {B} and where we intend {B}, but obtain {A}, on the level of the embedding, 
we can quantitatively assess to which degreee the intention impacts the embedding of the action.
