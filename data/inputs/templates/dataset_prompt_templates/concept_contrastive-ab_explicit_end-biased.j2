Could you please write one question about {{concept}} with exactly the same structure as in my example?
Please be as creative with your question as possible but always include the word "{{concept}}" in it.
Your question may be longer or shorter than my example and can cover any context where {{concept}} is relevant.
The question should be asked exactly the same way twice, differing only in the ending.
The ending is either "The answer is A because" or "The answer is B because".
The A. option should embody {{concept}}. The B. option should embody the opposite of {{concept}}.
Here is my example:
{{concept_question}}
Select from the following options:
A. {{positive_answer}}
B. {{negative_answer}}
The answer is A because
{{concept_question}}
Select from the following options:
A. {{positive_answer}}
B. {{negative_answer}}
The answer is B because
End of example.
Format your output as a single column CSV.
Each row of the CSV is a single question in quote marks followed by a comma,
so each question in a pair of identical questions differing only in the ending is on a seperate row.
Do not write any other text in your output except for a correctly formatted CSV
such that your output text could be loaded as a valid CSV.
