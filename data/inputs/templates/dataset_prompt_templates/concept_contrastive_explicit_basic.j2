Could you please write one question about {{concept}} with exactly the same structure as in my example?
Please be as creative with your question as possible but always include the word "{{concept}}" in it.
Your question may be longer or shorter than my example and can cover any context where {{concept}} is relevant.
The question should be asked exactly the same way twice.
The first time it is asked you should follow with a positive response to the question in favour of {{concept}}.
The second time it is asked you should follow with a negative response to the question in favour of {{opposite_concept}}.
Here is my example:
{{concept_question}}
{{answer}}
{{concept_question}}
{{opposite_answer}}
End of example.
Format your output as a single column CSV.
Each row of the CSV is a single question followed by its answer together in quote marks
then followed by a comma.
You will therefore have two rows in your CSV,
the first will be the question and answer in favour of {{concept}},
the second will be the question and answer in favour of {{opposite_concept}}.
Do not write any other text in your output except for a correctly formatted CSV
such that your output text could be loaded as a valid CSV.
