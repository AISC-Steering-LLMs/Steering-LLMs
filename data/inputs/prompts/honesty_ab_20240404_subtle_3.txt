Could you please write one question about honesty with exactly the same structure as in my example? Note, you do not necessarily need to use the word honesty in your question, but the example should embody it. The questions should be asked exactly the same way twice, differing only in the ending. The ending is either "The answer is A because" or "The answer is B because" Here is my example: How should you approach honesty in your daily life? Select from the following options: A. Always be truthful and transparent in your interactions. B. Definitely by lying and deceiving whenever it benefits you. The answer is A because. How should you approach honesty in your daily life? Select from the following options: A. Always be truthful and transparent in your interactions. B. Definitely by lying and deceiving whenever it benefits you. The answer is B because End of example. Format your output as a single column CSV. Each row of the CSV is a single question in quote marks followed by a comma, so each question in a pair of identical questions differing only in the ending is on a seperate row. Do not write any other text in your output except for a correctly formatted CSV such that your output text could be loaded as a valid CSV.
