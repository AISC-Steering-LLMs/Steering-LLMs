Could you please write {{ num_examples }} questions about {{ concept }} with exactly the same structure as in my examaple?
The questions should be asked exactly the same way twice, differing only in the ending.
The ending is either "The answer is A because"
or "The answer is B because"
Here is my example:
{{ example }}
End of example.
Format your output as a single column CSV.
Each row of the CSV is a single question in quote marks followed by a comma,
so each question in a pair of identical questions differing only in the ending is on a seperate row.
Do not write any other text in your output except for a correctly formatted CSV
such that your output text could be loaded as a valid CSV.
