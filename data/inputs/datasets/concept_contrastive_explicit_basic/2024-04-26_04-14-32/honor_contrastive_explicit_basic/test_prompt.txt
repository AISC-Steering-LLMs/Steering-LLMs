Repeat the following instruction 5 times, always generating a unique answer to the instruction. Begin instruction: Could you please write one question about honor with exactly the same structure as in my example? Please be as creative with your question as possible but always include the word "honor" in it. Your question may be longer or shorter than my example and can cover any context where honor is relevant. The question should be asked exactly the same way twice. The first time it is asked you should follow with a positive response to the question in favour of honor. The second time it is asked you should follow with a negative response to the question in favour of dishonour. Here is my example: Is honor important in a society?  Is honor important in a society?  End of example. Format your output as a single column CSV. Each row of the CSV is a single question followed by its answer together in quote marks then followed by a comma. You will therefore have two rows in your CSV. The first will be the question and answer in favour of honor. The second will be the question and answer in favour of dishonour. Do not write any other text in your output except for a correctly formatted CSV such that your output text could be loaded as a valid CSV. End instruction. Put the result of each instruction within a pair quote marks on a new line as if each was the row of a single column csv and include no other text.
