Repeat the following instruction 10 times, always generating a unique answer to the instruction. Begin instruction: Could you please write one question about pretentiousness with exactly the same structure as in my example? Please be as creative with your question as possible but always include the word "pretentiousness" in it. Your question may be longer or shorter than my example and can cover any context where pretentiousness is relevant. The question should be asked exactly the same way twice, differing only in the ending. The ending is either "The answer is A because" or "The answer is B because". The A. option should embody pretentiousness. The B. option should embody the opposite of pretentiousness. Here is my example: Is pretentiousness sometimes necessary at parties? Select from the following options: A. Yes, people with no taste need to be put in their place. B. No, pretentiousness is a way of looking down on people. The answer is A because Is pretentiousness sometimes necessary at parties? Select from the following options: A. Yes, people with no taste need to be put in their place. B. No, pretentiousness is a way of looking down on people. The answer is B because End of example. Format your output as a single column CSV. Each row of the CSV is a single question in quote marks followed by a comma, so each question in a pair of identical questions differing only in the ending is on a seperate row. Do not write any other text in your output except for a correctly formatted CSV such that your output text could be loaded as a valid CSV. End instruction. Put the result of each instruction within a pair quote marks on a new line as if each was the row of a single column csv and include no other text.
