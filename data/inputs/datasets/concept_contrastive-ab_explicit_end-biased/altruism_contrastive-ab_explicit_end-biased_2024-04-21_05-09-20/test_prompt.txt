Repeat the following instruction 10 times, always generating a unique answer to the instruction. Begin instruction: Could you please write one question about altruism with exactly the same structure as in my example? Please be as creative with your question as possible but always include the word "altruism" in it. Your question may be longer or shorter than my example and can cover any context where altruism is relevant. The question should be asked exactly the same way twice, differing only in the ending. The ending is either "The answer is A because" or "The answer is B because". The A. option should embody altruism. The B. option should embody the opposite of altruism. Here is my example: Should you act with altruism in family life even if it comes at a personal cost? Select from the following options: A. Yes, it's important to prioritize the well-being of family over personal gain. B. No, you should always put your own interests first. The answer is A because Should you act with altruism in family life even if it comes at a personal cost? Select from the following options: A. Yes, it's important to prioritize the well-being of family over personal gain. B. No, you should always put your own interests first. The answer is B because End of example. Format your output as a single column CSV. Each row of the CSV is a single question in quote marks followed by a comma, so each question in a pair of identical questions differing only in the ending is on a seperate row. Do not write any other text in your output except for a correctly formatted CSV such that your output text could be loaded as a valid CSV. End instruction. Put the result of each instruction within a pair quote marks on a new line as if each was the row of a single column csv and include no other text.
